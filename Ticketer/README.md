# Ticketer

As a working student i couldn't buy monthly ticket because that's only allowed between nearest train station to home location and station nearest of University residency which in my case was Nov√°ky and Trnava. Unfortunately my work wasn't between this two towns so i neede to buy ticket every day. This wasn't really pleasant experience.
For example i couldn' register or login i think it was because the cashier wriete wrong e-mail when i registered for my train card. Another problem that run into was when i bought ticket i was always doing screenshots because i use to close all the app's on my phone when put it in my pocket so it happened that i close browser and when ticket collector come to me and asks for my ticket and opened the browser the ticket wouldn't be there, there is alert "Are you sure you want to submit this form again" (Cancle, Submit) but even i click cancle it would leave me on black empty page. Last problem that i have was when the main mobile page was open and i closed the browser and after shift i would open the browser and the type the stations set the time and click search i would get "Error 404--Not Found" this was frustrating as i need to close the tab and reopen the site and type everything again.
First i was trying to look into insceptor if i can find what they send to Back-end but i didn't find anything. Then i try to use the WireShark but i wasn't really familiar with this tool and i came to the article about Google Puppet headless browser i give it try first there wasn't support for downloading files but it was later added. Quickly i made prototype just for my self but then i ask my self how would i imagine this kind of site. I wouldn't cover all usecases that the ikvc.slovakrails does. So i was looking at the dribbble and get some ideas.
